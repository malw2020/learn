## Unix, linux

Unix is essential in software development.

## C

C is a small language. And it helps you better understand
how system works in low-level. It's still being used everywhere.
I only wish I had more time to learn more about C.

## C++

[**_Is learning C++ still worthwhile?_**](http://www.quora.com/Is-learning-C++-still-worthwhile)
Yes! I really want to learn more about C++:

> C++ is one of the most widely used programming languages
> in the world. Well-written C++ programs are fast and efficient.
> The language is more flexible than other languages because you
> can use it to create a wide range of apps—from fun and exciting
> games, to high-performance scientific software, to device drivers,
> embedded programs, and Windows client apps. For more than 20 years,
> C++ has been used to solve problems like these and many others.

## Go

I like [*Go*](https://golang.org/) for its simplicity: less design 
concerns to consider and less frameworks to learn. Plus I love its great communities.
Go is not perfect but really good at [*doing less, enabling more*](https://blog.golang.org/open-source).
It's a great introductory language between *Python* and *C++*.
**I want to know a lot about [C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B)
and [Go](https://golang.org/) to build my foundation.**
This will help my transition to other languages or frameworks if needed.

## Python

Python is probably fast enough for many of what we need to do today.
And it's relatively easy to learn and use, with rich ecosystems in
data science, web frameworks, scripting, and many others.

## Computer systems

It's very important to understand hardware and low-level programming.
I believe this will help a lot when you wonder why your high level program
is not working or not performing well. I will take as much time as 
I need―nothing like cramming 1,200 page computer systems book in 12 weeks.

## Security systems

[*MIT course*](http://css.csail.mit.edu/6.858/2014/schedule.html) explains that
*security achieves confidentiality, integrity, availability―policy*. And the goal is
to make sure there is no way for adversary within threat model to violate this policy.

## Database systems

We are *generating* and *consuming* vast amounts of data in unprecendented
pace in human history. Database systems are the workhorses of our data 
analysis applications.

## Linguistics, natural language processing

I love linguistics, and its computational applications.

## Mathematics, statistics

Most prominent solutions in Computer Science often come from mathematics. 
Arbitrary, unrelated things can fit together when you have mathematical
backgrounds. Statistics helps solve intractable problems through approximation 
algorithms, machine learning algorithms, etc.
